Welcome to Crossborder Code, a project by Matthew Potts.

I've also recently [dived into the behaviour of the U.S. dollar](research/U.S.Assets.DuringGFC/U.S.Assets.During.Crisis.ipynb) during the Global Financial Crisis 2007-08. Following [Setser](https://www.cfr.org/article/foreign-money-flowed-out-us-not-during-global-financial-crisis), I argue that, rather than on account of being a global safe asset, the dollar rallied due to the need to close out carry trading positions.

A [prior research piece](research/BankLendingVsCapitalMarkets/BankLendingVsCapitalMarkets.ipynb), meanwhile, examines the evolution of international funding over the last 25 years, highlighting how funding models have diverged between Emerging Markets and Developed Economies.

I've also developed an [open-source](https://github.com/matthew-potts/getBISy) Python package - [*getBISy*](https://pypi.org/project/getBISy/) - which allows the user to access to international financial datasets released by the Bank for International Settlements via their [Stats API](https://stats.bis.org/api-doc/v2/).
