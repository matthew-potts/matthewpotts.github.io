I am passionate how bringing data and technology to financial and economic research, and building technical systems that can be used to inform both analysis and decision-making. 

I've recently researched  topics such as the carry trade during the Great Financial Crisis 2007-08 and the evolution of cross-border funding in the 21st century, I'm particularly motivated by 'bridging the gap' between the fields of data engineering and investment research. To this end I always include samples of code that I've used to conduct my analysis.

In my 'day job' as a software engineer in trading technology, I develop data-intensive batch-processing systems that inform balance-sheet optimisation at the UK's largest bank, developing across a stack including Python, C#, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

I'm interested in the role of AI and LLMs in research workflows, and I also enjoy integrating AI into my own development process.

My interest in international finance and geoeconomics makes me particularly interested in Chinaâ€™s role in the global system. I lived in Beijing for a year in 2019 and am currently working towards the HSK 5 qualification in Mandarin.
