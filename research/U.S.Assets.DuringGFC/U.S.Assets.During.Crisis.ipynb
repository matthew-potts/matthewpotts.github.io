    "A recent article by [article by Brad Setser](https://www.cfr.org/article/foreign-money-flowed-out-us-not-during-global-financial-crisis) highlighted an interesting misconception about the behaviour of the dollar during the Global Financial Crisis 2007-08: namely, that the dollar rallied because of a flight-to-safety of foreign capital from abroad, in turn reflecting the dollar's status at this time reflects its position as a global reserve currency. In fact, \"a careful fact check would show that capital from abroad—unambiguously—flowed out of the U.S. market in late 2008.\" "
